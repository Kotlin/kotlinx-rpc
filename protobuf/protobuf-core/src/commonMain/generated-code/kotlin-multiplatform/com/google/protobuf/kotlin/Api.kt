/**
* Declares an API Interface to be included in this interface. The including
* interface must redeclare all the methods from the included interface, but
* documentation and options are inherited as follows:
* 
* - If after comment and whitespace stripping, the documentation
*   string of the redeclared method is empty, it will be inherited
*   from the original method.
* 
* - Each annotation belonging to the service config (http,
*   visibility) which is not set in the redeclared method will be
*   inherited.
* 
* - If an http annotation is inherited, the path pattern will be
*   modified as follows. Any version prefix will be replaced by the
*   version of the including interface plus the [root][] path if
*   specified.
* 
* Example of a simple mixin:
* 
*     package google.acl.v1;
*     service AccessControl {
*       // Get the underlying ACL object.
*       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
*         option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl";
*       }
*     }
* 
*     package google.storage.v2;
*     service Storage {
*       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl);
* 
*       // Get a data record.
*       rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) {
*         option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}";
*       }
*     }
* 
* Example of a mixin configuration:
* 
*     apis:
*     - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
*       mixins:
*       - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
* 
* The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are
* also declared with same name and request/response types in
* `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will
* see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inheriting
* documentation and annotations as follows:
* 
*     service Storage {
*       // Get the underlying ACL object.
*       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
*         option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl";
*       }
*       ...
*     }
* 
* Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.
* 
* If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a
* relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example:
* 
*     apis:
*     - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
*       mixins:
*       - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
*         root: acls
* 
* This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation:
* 
*     service Storage {
*       // Get the underlying ACL object.
*       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
*         option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl";
*       }
*       ...
*     }
