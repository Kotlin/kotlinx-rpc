/**
 * The scope of a single outgoing gRPC client call observed by a [ClientInterceptor].
 *
 * An interceptor receives this scope instance for every call and can:
 * - Inspect the RPC [method] being invoked.
 * - Read or populate [requestHeaders] before the request is sent.
 * - Read [callOptions] that affect transport-level behavior.
 * - Register callbacks with [onHeaders] and [onClose] to observe response metadata and final status.
 * - Cancel the call early via [cancel].
 * - Continue the call by calling [proceed] with a (possibly transformed) request [Flow].
 * - Transform the response by modifying the returned [Flow].
 *
 * ```kt
 *  val interceptor = object : ClientInterceptor {
 *      override fun <Request, Response> ClientCallScope<Request, Response>.intercept(
 *          request: Flow<Request>
 *      ): Flow<Response> {
 *          // Example: add a header before proceeding
 *          requestHeaders[MyKeys.Authorization] = token
 *
 *          // Example: observe response metadata
 *          onHeaders { headers -> /* inspect headers */ }
 *          onClose { status, trailers -> /* log status/trailers */ }
 *
 *          // IMPORTANT: proceed forwards the call to the next interceptor/transport.
 *          // If you do not call proceed, no request will be sent and the call is short-circuited.
 *          return proceed(request)
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * @param Request the request message type of the RPC.
 * @param Response the response message type of the RPC.
