 * - Inspect the target RPC [method].
 * - Read client-provided [requestHeaders].
 * - Populate [responseHeaders] (sent before the first response message) and [responseTrailers]
 *   (sent when the call completes).
 * - Register a completion callback with [onClose].
 * - Abort the call early with [close].
 * - Continue handling by calling [proceed] with the inbound request [Flow] and optionally transform
 *   the returned response [Flow].

 * @param Request the request message type of the RPC.
 * @param Response the response message type of the RPC.
